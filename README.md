# breast-cancer-risk-prediction
Predicting breast cancer recurrence and survival risk using the METABRIC dataset with EDA, feature engineering, and ML models like logistic regression, SVM, and decision trees.
This project uses the METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium) dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts the risk of breast cancer recurrence and survival. It includes:
🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
⚙️ Feature engineering and preprocessing  
🤖 Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees)  
📊 Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC  
📁 Built in Python using Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib  
The goal of this project is to assist in better clinical decision-making and risk stratification for breast cancer patients using real-world genetic and clinical data. 
🧪 The project demonstrates the practical application of data science in healthcare by turning complex medical data into actionable insights.
